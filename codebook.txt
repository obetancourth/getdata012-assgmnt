tidy_wearable_summarized_data CodeBook
==============================================================================

This codebook lists all variables and column number for the
tidy_wearable_summarized_data.txt dataset.

All variable prefixed with an avg_t derives from time domain variables
obtained from 2.56s window at 50Hz cicles specified in the rawData Readme.txt
file and features-info.txt file.

All variables prefixed with an avg_f belongs to a frecuency domain

All measurment variables ranges from -1 to 1
